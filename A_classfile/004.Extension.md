## Java Source Code VS Java Compiled Class

> 作者有话说：之所以将Java Source Code和Java compiled classes的对比放到最后，是因为此时诸位已经对两者都有了一定的了解，在此时来讲，能够更加明白含义。如果放到一开始去讲，很可能讲不清楚。

There are however some differences between source and compiled classes:

- A compiled class describes only one class, while a source file can contain several classes. For instance a source file describing a class with one inner class is compiled in two class files: one for the main class and one for the inner class. However the main class file contains references to its inner classes, and inner classes defined inside methods contain a reference to their enclosing method.

- A compiled class does not contain comments, of course, but can contain class, field, method and code attributes that can be used to associate additional information to these elements.

- A compiled class does not contain a `package` and `import` section, so all type names must be fully qualified.

Another very important **structural difference** is that **a compiled class** contains **a constant pool section**. This pool is an array containing all the numeric, string and type constants that appear in the class. These constants are defined only once, in the constant pool section, and are referenced by their index in all other sections of the class file.

Another important difference is that **Java types** are represented differently in **compiled** and **source classes**.
