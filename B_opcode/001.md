要讲述Code属性位于什么位置：位于method的Code属性里。

就像动词+宾主->结果

方法（参数）->返回值。

**Java bytecode** is the instruction set of the Java virtual machine (JVM).

The JVM is both a **stack machine** and a **register machine**. Each frame for a method call has an "**operand stack**" and an array of "**local variables**". **The operand stack** is used for operands to computations and for receiving the return value of a called method, while **local variables** serve the same purpose as registers and are also used to pass method arguments. The maximum size of **the operand stack** and **local variable array**, computed by the compiler, is part of the attributes of each method. Each can be independently sized from `0` to `65535` values, where each value is 32 bits. long and double types, which are 64 bits, take up two consecutive(连续的) local variables (which need not be 64-bit aligned in the local variables array) or one value in the operand stack (but are counted as two units in the depth of the stack).
